# FishPredictionApplication  

**FishPredictionApplication** is a machine learning solution built with **XGBoost**, designed to predict fish species based on given features. The application leverages supervised learning to ensure accurate and efficient classification of fish data.  


## Features  

- **Fish Species Classification**: Predict fish species based on input data using a trained XGBoost model.  
- **High Accuracy**: Optimized supervised learning ensures precise predictions.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for inputting features and viewing results.  
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Quickly processes input data to deliver instant results.  

## How It Works  

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Input data is preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the model.  
2. **Model Training**: The XGBoost classifier is trained on labeled fish data, achieving high accuracy.  
3. **Prediction**: The trained model predicts fish species based on the provided features.  

## How to Use  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FishPredictionApplication.git  
   cd FishPredictionApplication  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Run the Application**:  
   Launch the application for real-time predictions:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  

4. **Provide Input**:  
   Enter feature values (e.g., length, weight) into the app to get a fish species prediction.
